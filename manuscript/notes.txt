• It is necessary to explore more the methods in order to make a comparison
    [ ] I have not found more literature about this topic and I've already discussed the other works in the related work. So, I added a new paragraph to the limitations section (5.4)
 
• There is no important issues like Hypothesis, research questions, etc.
    [x] I have rewritten the two last paragraphs in the Introduction section (1)

• Maybe, the manuscript could be restructured since there is a merge of content (methodology and
method).
    [ ] I have moved section PondionsTracker-BH (4.4) and its subsections to the Results chapter. So, now this section is the first section of the Results.  

• The size of chapters, in terms of number of pages, is an important measure to be considered.
    [x] OK

• I suggest you to make a block diagram in the methodology description in order to show a high
level point of view. In the following, details could be presented.
    [ ] Figure 13 shows this high level point of view, so I have changed section Integration Driver's (4.3.6) second paragraph to express this high level point of view.

• What is the difference between your work and the work on Rome?
    [ ] This topic was already discussed in Related Work's fourth paragraph but I have modified to clearly express the difference between Belo Horizonte and Rome. 

• Which means “our approach decrease de delay”?
    [x] OK

• What’s the difference between LayerBase and PondionsTracker?
    [x] OK - There is a substantial difference between both, so I`m keeping this discussion as a future work only.

• Dynamic graph versus Static graph
• Weekday and weekend?
• Why did you graph in this model?
    [ ] 

• Delay could be related to cut set? Shortest path, etc?
    [ ] These ideas are out the scope of this dissertation. But these ideas are interesting to apply, so, I`ve increased the future work to discuss about the usage of graphs methods.

• Same missing from Davide’s first question.
    [x] OK - I'm not sure which was the first question, but if I'm not mistaken, it is related to graph modeling. So, this topic is solved by the previous one.

• Start: 13h05 – Finish: 13h45
    [x] OK
